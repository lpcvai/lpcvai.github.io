                    Recent advances in deep learning have provided significant
                    improvements in the ability to understand visual content.
                    Mainstream computer vision research often gives little
                    consideration to computation time, resource requirements,
                    and constraints such as energy consumption, memory footprint
                    and model size, or carbon emission. As computer vision is
                    increasingly deployed in resource-limited systems (such as
                    mobile phones, wearable devices, Internet of Things,
                    autonomous aerial vehicles), addressing all of these metrics
                    becomes essential. In this yearâ€™s ECV workshop, the topics
                    of interest include but are not limited to the following:
